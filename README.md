C Program for Singly Linked List Operations
This repository contains a comprehensive, menu-driven C program that implements various operations on a singly linked list. It serves as a practical tool for learning and demonstrating fundamental data structure concepts.

Description
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. This program provides a hands-on implementation of a singly linked list, allowing users to perform a wide range of actions through an interactive command-line menu. It covers everything from basic creation and traversal to more complex operations like sorting and reversal.

Features Implemented
The program includes the following 17 operations:

Traverse the list: Prints all the elements in the list.

Count nodes: Counts the total number of nodes.

Insert at the beginning: Adds a new element to the start of the list.

Insert at the end: Adds a new element to the end of the list.

Insert at a specific position: Inserts a new element at a user-defined position.

Insert after a specific element: Inserts a new element after a node with a given value.

Delete the first node: Removes the first element.

Delete the last node: Removes the last element.

Delete node at a specific position: Removes an element from a user-defined position.

Delete node after a specific element: Removes the node that comes after a node with a given value.

Reverse the list: Reverses the order of all elements.

Append another list: Creates a second list and appends it to the end of the original list.

Find the middle element: Finds the middle node without a full count (using the slow/fast pointer method).

Find the maximum element: Finds the node with the highest value.

Find the minimum element: Finds the node with the lowest value.

Sort the list: Sorts the list in ascending order using a bubble sort algorithm.

Exit: Terminates the program.

How to Compile and Run
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

Compile the C file:
You will need a C compiler like gcc.

gcc linked_list_operations.c -o linked_list

Run the executable:

./linked_list

Usage
Once the program is running, it will first prompt you to create an initial linked list. After that, a menu with all the available operations will be displayed. Simply enter the number corresponding to the operation you wish to perform and follow the on-screen prompts.
